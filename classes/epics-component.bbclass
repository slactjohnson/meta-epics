# - buildpaths is to suppress complaints about the build host (class-native)
#   package containing references to TMPDIR, which is fine because these are
#   not installed on the target, only used in compilation of the target package
# - dev-so prevents the build erroring out from symlinks like libca.so -> libco.so.1.2.3. you're "supposed" to put these in a dev package.
